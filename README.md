# commander
commander is an interactive command processor, similar to python's CMD2, but written for golang.  it is not a golang REPL, but rather an interactive shell environment which allows the user to define and implement rich commands, which can then be executed with amenities such as:

- full tab completion
- contextual help
- stdout piping and redirection
